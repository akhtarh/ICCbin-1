\description{
Estimates Intracluster Correlation Coefficients (ICC) in 14 different methods and it's confidence intervals in 4 different methods given the data on cluster labels and outcomes
}
\details{
If in the dataframe, the cluster id (\code{cid}) is not a factor, it will be changed to a factor and a warning message will be given

If estimate of ICC in any method is outside the interval [0, 1], the estimate and corresponding confidence interval (if appropriate) and warning messages will be produced

If the lower limit of any confidence interval is below 0 and upper limit is above 1, they will be replaced by 0 and 1 respectively and warning message will be produced

The method \code{aov} computes the analysis of variance estimate of ICC. This estimator was originally proposed for continuous variables, but various authors (e.g. Elston, 1977) have suggested it's use for binary variables

The method \code{aovs} gives estimate of ICC using a modification of analysis of variance technique (see Fleiss, 1981)

The method \code{keq} computes moment estimate of ICC suggested by Kleinman (1973), uses equal weight, \eqn{w_{i} = 1/k} for each of \eqn{k} clusters

The method \code{kpr} computes moment estimate of ICC suggested by Kleinman (1973), uses weights proportionto cluster size \eqn{w_{i} = n_{i}/N}

The method \code{keqs} gives a modified moment estimate of ICC with equal weights (\code{keq}) (see Kleinman, 1973)

The method \code{kprs} gives a modified moment estimate of ICC with weights proportional to cluster size (\code{kpr}) (see Kleinman, 1973)

The method \code{stab} provides a stabilized estimate of ICC proposed by Tamura and Young (1987)

The method \code{ub} computes moment estimate of ICC from an unbiased estimating equation (see Yamamoto and Yanagimoto, 1992)

The method \code{fc} gives Fleiss-Cuzick estimate of ICC (see Fleiss and Cuzick, 1979)

The method \code{mak} computes Mak's estimate of ICC (see Mak, 1988)

The method \code{peq} computes weighted correlation estimate of ICC proposed by karlin, Cameron, and Williams (1981) using equal weight to every pair of observations

The method \code{pgp} computes weighted correlation estimate of ICC proposed by karlin, Cameron, and Williams (1981) using equal weight to each cluster irrespective of size

The method \code{ppr} computes weighted correlation estimate of ICC proposed by karlin, Cameron, and Williams (1981) by weighting each pair according to the total number of pairs in which the individuals appear

The method \code{rm} estimates ICC using resampling method proposed by Chakraborty and Sen (2016)

The CI type \code{aov} computes confidence interval for ICC using Simith's large sample approximation (see Smith, 1957)

The CI type \code{fc} gives Fleiss-Cuzick confidence interval for ICC (see Fleiss and Cuzick, 1979)

The CI type \code{peq} estimates confidenc einterval for ICC based on direct calculation of correlation between observations within clusters (see Wu, Crespi, and Wong, 2012)

The CI type \code{rm} gives confidence interval for ICC using resampling method by Chakraborty and Sen (2016)
